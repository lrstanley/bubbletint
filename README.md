## BubbleTint

Still a work-in-progress, please don't use.

## TODO

- [ ] tests
- [ ] better documentation
- [ ] example with dynamic theme switcher
- [ ] performance tests
- [ ] any approach to dark vs light?
- [ ] how to handle empty colors? function that wraps `lipgloss.Color()`?
- [ ] some tints are missing (day vs night, maybe those are keys and not in the name?)
- [ ] wrap tints in a color palette type, so they can be used directly? of some initialized variable so don't have to initialize struct?
